[Here is a link to the final project]()

This site is a comprehensive hotel reservation system, designed to streamline the operations of both hotel owners and guests alike. This platform is tailored to enhance the user experience for those seeking accommodations, offering a seamless journey from browsing to booking.

This site is fully responsive on all modern screen sizes, and it allows the site users/guests to easily add, edit or delete their profiles, reservations, and the site owner to have the same functionality to handle the hotel and room details.

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django, and it uses a SQL database through Code Institute.

## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

- This project is something I wanted to create as I'm a passionate traveler which led me to use plenty of hotel booking sites and I've previously been working in the hotel buisness as well.
- I wanted to create a website linked to a database, which allows users to log in, view hotel information, room details, and make room reservations.
- I wanted the administration to be able to add, edit and delete hotel information, room details and reservations.

### Project Goals

- The main goal is to create an easily editable site to elevate the guest experience and simplify hotel operations.
- Designed with a user-centric approach, the platform should cater the needs of site users, site owners, staff users, and admin users.
- This project also demonstrates my understanding of maintaining a database attached to a website, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality, using CI SQL database, and Cloudinairy Services
