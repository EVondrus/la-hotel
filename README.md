[Here is a link to the final project]()

This site is a comprehensive hotel reservation system, designed to streamline the operations of both hotel owners and guests alike. This platform is tailored to enhance the user experience for those seeking accommodations, offering a seamless journey from browsing to booking.

This site is fully responsive on all modern screen sizes, and it allows the site users/guests to easily add, edit or delete their profiles, reservations, and the site owner to have the same functionality to handle the hotel and room details.

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django, and it uses a SQL database through Code Institute.
