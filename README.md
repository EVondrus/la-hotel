[Here is a link to the final project]()

This site is a comprehensive hotel reservation system, designed to streamline the operations of both hotel owners and guests alike. This platform is tailored to enhance the user experience for those seeking accommodations, offering a seamless journey from browsing to booking.

This site is fully responsive on all modern screen sizes, and it allows the site users/guests to easily add, edit or delete their profiles, reservations, and the site owner to have the same functionality to handle the hotel and room details.

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django, and it uses a SQL database through Code Institute.

## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

- This project is something I wanted to create as I'm a passionate traveler which led me to use plenty of hotel booking sites and I've previously been working in the hotel buisness as well.
- I wanted to create a website linked to a database, which allows users to log in, view hotel information, room details, and make room reservations.
- I wanted the administration to be able to add, edit and delete hotel information, room details and reservations.

### User Stories

### Project Goals

- The main goal is to create an easily editable site to elevate the guest experience and simplify hotel operations.
- Designed with a user-centric approach, the platform should cater the needs of site users, site owners, staff users, and admin users.
- This project also demonstrates my understanding of maintaining a database attached to a website, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality, using CI SQL database, and Cloudinairy Services

## Design

### Color Scheme

TBC

- The main colors used in this site are Dark Slater Blue, Gold/Beige and Cloudy White.

* These main colors are the colors in the hotels's logo, and they permeate through the site.

- These colors were each selected to embody the serene elegance and natural beauty of a Scandinavia, reflecting the tranquil ambiance and sophisticated charm of the setting.
- A dark green has been used for the sucess messages, to signify that this is a successive action.
- A dark red has been used for all Delete buttons, to signify that this is a destructive action.
- The darker yellow has been used for the hover state of the call-to-action buttons.
- ?! Different color shades have also been used on the hover state of the social media icons on the Contact page to match the icons.

### Typography

TBC

- For the fonts, I selected Roboto Slab for headings and Open Sans for body text, both available through Google Fonts.
- These choices were made with a keen focus on readability and accessibility, ensuring a welcoming experience for users with dyslexia and partial visual impairments.
- The elegance and readability of these fonts contribute to the app's overall sophistication and ease of use.
- By utilizing the standard HTML font size of 16px, ensuring to not have any fonts smaller than that, to aid visually impaired users.
- Also, the recommended smallest font size for accessible websites is 12px, so by keeping all font sizes at the HTML standard of  (?! 16px) or above, I ensured to be fully compliant with the [Penn State University Accessibility and Usability Guidelines](https://accessibility.psu.edu/fontsizehtml/).
- Font sizes are also able to be zoomed to 200% without losing contrast or functionality, to comply with the [WCAG Guidelines on fonts](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html).
- Lastly, to prevent the app from appearing overly assertive, I incorporated a mix of uppercase and lowercase text strategically.
